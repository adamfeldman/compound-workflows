# Project Context

## Overview
- Plugin: compound-workflows v1.13.2 (plugins/compound-workflows/)
- 25 agents, 19 skills, 8 commands
- Commands under `/compound:*`, skills under `/compound-workflows:*`
- Forked from Every's compound-engineering (February 2026), fully self-contained
- GitHub repo: adamfeldman/compound-workflows (public)

## Architecture Decisions
- **Namespace `/compound:*`** — shorter to type. Exception: `plugin-changes-qa` and `recover` are skills under `/compound-workflows:*` due to per-directory command limit (~8).
- **Single work executor** — `/compound:work` IS the subagent architecture. Main context runs out of context and never finishes.
- **Config split** — `compound-workflows.md` (committed, project) + `compound-workflows.local.md` (gitignored, env). Red team prefs runtime-detected.
- **`.workflows/` committed in user projects** (research traceability), gitignored in this plugin source repo.
- **Deferring is OK** when user explicitly chooses it — "zero untriaged items" not "zero deferred items".

## Critical Discoveries
- **Nested Task dispatch does NOT work** — subagents cannot spawn further subagents. Use flat dispatch.
- **Claude Code hooks cannot trigger slash commands** — use PostToolUse on Bash instead. Sentinel `.workflows/.work-in-progress` suppresses during `/compound:work`.
- **Subagents cannot write to `.claude/` directory** — orchestrator must handle protected paths.
- **Claude Code per-directory command limit** — ~8 commands per `commands/` subdirectory. Overflow goes to `skills/`.
- **Marketplace clone** — cache at `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/<name>/` is a full git clone. Use `claude plugin update compound-workflows@compound-workflows-marketplace`.
- **`bd list --json` does NOT produce JSON** — use `bd search "" --status open --json` instead.
- **`bd search` default limit is 50** — pass `--limit N` for more.
- **`bd update --append-notes`** — appends (not overwrites). Use instead of `--notes`.
- **bd worktree create uses path as-is** — pass `.worktrees/<name>` explicitly.
- **Loaded skill staleness** — skills loaded at conversation start from cached plugin version. Mid-session updates don't refresh loaded skills. Also affects new agents — created mid-session won't appear in `subagent_type` list.
- **Agent tool has no `model` parameter** — cannot override model at dispatch time. `general-purpose` always inherits parent model. Named agents respect `model` field in frontmatter (proven: haiku and sonnet both work — sonnet validated 2026-03-09 by temporarily editing installed cache).
- **worktree-manager.sh uses `cleanup` not `remove`** — `bash worktree-manager.sh cleanup` to remove completed worktrees (interactive y/n).
- **Worktree blocks `gh pr merge`** — use `gh api repos/.../pulls/N/merge -X PUT -f merge_method=squash` instead.

## Session Log Format
- Path: `~/.claude/projects/<path-with-dashes>/<session-id>.jsonl`
- Entry types: progress, assistant, user, file-history-snapshot, queue-operation, system, custom-title, last-prompt

## Completed Work
- **v1.7.0** — Plan readiness agents (PR #1)
- **v1.8.0** — Context-lean enforcement + QA enhancement (PR #2)
- **v1.9.0** — Finding resolution provenance (PR #3)
- **v1.9.1** — Plan deepen recommendation (PR #5)
- **v1.10.0** — Three-category MINOR triage (PR #6)
- **v1.11.0** — Plugin version visibility (PR #7): version-check.sh, version-sync.sh, /compound-workflows:version skill, compact-prep/setup/work.md integrations, doc alignment
- **v1.12.0** — QA bead cross-ref (PR #8)
- **v1.12.1** — Bug fixes: stale /compound:recover refs, compact-prep $ARGUMENTS syntax, work.md sequential-as-safer bias, context-lean-grep false positives (13 SERIOUS → 0)
- **v1.9.0** — Deepen-plan convergence guidance (PR #4): convergence-signals.sh, convergence-advisor.md, Phase 5.75/6/1 in deepen-plan.md

- **v1.12.2** — Dynamic plugin script path resolution via `find` (version-check.sh, plugin-qa)
- **v1.13.0** — Setup routing rules (AGENTS.md), conditional compact-prep release check
- **v1.13.1** — All remaining hardcoded plugin paths fixed (plan.md, deepen-plan.md, work.md, setup.md, plugin-changes-qa)
- **v1.13.2** — version-check.sh consumer project bug, QA agent noise reduction (awx), roadmap table in root README

## In-Progress Work
- **Workflow quota optimization (bead 22l)** — plan complete at `docs/plans/2026-03-09-feat-workflow-quota-optimization-plan.md`. Next: `/compound:deepen-plan`. Key decisions: Sonnet for 5 research agents + relay wrappers (via named `red-team-relay` agent in `agents/workflow/`), Opus for everything else. `model: sonnet` validated empirically. Target v2.0.
- **Red team model selection (bead aig)** — brainstorm complete. Next: `/compound:plan`.
- **Correction-capture skill (bead rhl)** — new P2. Next: `/compound:brainstorm`.

## Critical Patterns
- **Plugin paths must use `find` fallback** — all script/file references in commands/skills need dynamic resolution: try local path, then `find "$HOME/.claude/plugins" ...`. Affects any new command referencing plugin scripts.
- **version-check.sh context detection** — in source repo: 3-way (source vs installed vs release). In consumer project: 2-way (installed vs release only).
- **`.beads/PRIME.md`** overrides bd prime to remove conflicting memory instructions

## Dependency Chain
- aig → h0g (aig now unblocked)
- 0ob(done), dud(done), 1q3(done), 4gq(done), n2q(done), 3co(done), d2l(done), awx(done)
- `.beads/PRIME.md` overrides bd prime to remove conflicting memory instructions
