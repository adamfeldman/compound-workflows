# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- GC fail-closed on git errors — preserves worktrees when git commands fail instead of deleting them
- GC `--dry-run` mode — `/do:work` liveness probes no longer risk deleting the worktree they're checking
- Old-format `.session.pid` files pruned during liveness checks, unblocking GC of legacy worktrees
- Path traversal, numeric validation, and lock-busy reporting hardened in `session-gc.sh`
- `/do:work` correctly classifies all GC SKIPPED reasons (blocks on concurrent sessions, proceeds on state issues)
- AGENTS.md: prefer `--no-ff` merge over squash (matches session-merge.sh's established pattern)

## [3.4.0] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- **Session worktrees created automatically at session start** — SessionStart hook now deterministically creates worktrees (100% reliable vs ~75% model compliance with instructions)
- **New `/do:start` command for session worktree management** — resume orphaned worktrees, clean up stale ones, rename sessions, check status — all interactively
- **Session-to-work worktree transition** — `/do:work` Phase 1.2 detects session worktrees and transitions to a purpose-named work worktree, preserving the session lifecycle separation
- **Combined PID + state cleanup** — `session-gc.sh` prevents concurrent sessions from deleting each other's worktrees by checking PID liveness before removal
- **`.workflows/` artifacts write to main repo root** — survives worktree lifecycle transitions so research and stats persist across session→work→merge

### Changed
- Pre-commit hook uses git plumbing (`git rev-parse`) for worktree detection instead of path heuristics
- SessionStart hook delegates PID tracking to `write-session-pid.sh` script
- AGENTS.md session worktree section rewritten for hook-first flow with `/do:start` fallback

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- Session worktree isolation now works — hook output delivered via stdout (not stderr), worktrees persist across sessions via `bd worktree` (not EnterWorktree)
- session-merge.sh no longer false-positives on untracked files
- session-merge.sh cleanup now uses two-stage filter to avoid removing /do:work worktrees

### Added
- Git pre-commit hook template blocks commits to main when session_worktree enabled (deterministic enforcement)
- PID-based concurrent session detection in SessionStart hook
- Legacy .claude/worktrees/ one-time migration cleanup

### Changed
- Worktree path namespace: `.claude/worktrees/` → `.worktrees/session-*`
- Exit mechanism: `ExitWorktree` → `cd` (CWD-based)
- Resume detection: CWD-based → `ls -d .worktrees/session-*`
- AGENTS.md wording: conditional → unconditional ("before doing anything else, create a session worktree")
- do-setup AGENTS.md injection includes v1→v2 migration detection

## [3.2.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixes

- **Compact-prep cost summary now shows accurate Sonnet savings** — corrected Opus:Sonnet ratio from 5x to 1.67x (Opus 4.6 pricing)

## [3.2.1] - 2026-03-15

### Improvements

- **Work step scoping based on coherence, not time** — changed from "15-60 minutes of focused work" to "one coherent unit of work completable in a single subagent dispatch." Time was a poor proxy that inflated estimates 3x.
- **Subagents no longer commit regenerated outputs** — work subagent template now instructs agents to only stage files they directly edited, preventing side-effect files (summary.md, raw-observations.jsonl) from leaking into commits.
- **Estimation heuristics split into rules + analysis** — actionable estimation guidance (beads vs work steps) separated from 400 lines of backing analysis data, reducing context load.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-03-14

### Features

- **Concurrent sessions no longer cross-contaminate commits** — each Claude Code session automatically gets its own git worktree (isolated index + working tree) via `EnterWorktree` at session start. Solo sessions fast-forward; concurrent sessions merge cleanly. Configurable via `session_worktree` key in `compound-workflows.local.md` (default: enabled).
- **New `/do:merge` skill** — retry deferred worktree merges when automatic merge at session end is skipped or fails. Runs `session-merge.sh` with conflict detection and user-guided resolution.
- **`safe-commit.sh` for opt-out users** — when worktree isolation is disabled, staging uses a temporary `GIT_INDEX_FILE` to prevent concurrent sessions from cross-contaminating each other's commits.
- **SessionStart hook detects orphaned worktrees** — warns at session start if stale worktrees exist from crashed sessions. `/compound-workflows:recover` adds worktree recovery operations (detect, merge, discard, inspect).
- **Compact-prep auto-merges worktree at session end** — commits in the worktree branch, merges to default branch, and calls `ExitWorktree` as part of the session-end flow.
- **`/do:work` detects session worktrees** — skips nested worktree creation when already in a session worktree, avoiding worktree-inside-worktree complexity.

### Changed

- Skills: 29 to 30 (added do-merge)

## [3.1.8] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Work-created beads now carry origin metadata** — `/do:work` adds `{"origin": "work", "plan": "<plan-file>"}` to `--metadata` when creating beads from plan decomposition, enabling analytics to segment work-created vs manually-created bead populations without relying on description-prefix heuristics.

## [3.1.7] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed

- **Skill init blocks no longer trigger permission prompts** — consolidated `mkdir -p .workflows/stats` and `CACHED_MODEL` env var capture into `init-values.sh`, so each skill's init code block is a single `bash init-values.sh` call. Eliminates compound-command heuristic triggers from `&&` chaining of mkdir, bash, and env var commands. (Robustness Principle 10)

## [3.1.6] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Compact-prep commit messages scoped per run** — commit message files now write to `.workflows/compact-prep/<run-id>/` instead of shared `.workflows/scratch/` path, eliminating race condition under concurrent sessions. Removed `.workflows/scratch/*` blanket exemption from `unslugged-paths.sh` QA script so future static paths are caught.

## [3.1.5] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- **Compact-prep run directory deferred to Step 3** — `mkdir` only runs when compound pause-and-resume actually needs it, instead of unconditionally at init.

## [3.1.4] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Stats capture no longer uses a shared pipe file** — eliminates race conditions under concurrent sessions and removes noisy Write tool diffs from the UI. Work-in-progress sentinel is now scoped per-session, so concurrent `/do:work` runs don't interfere with each other's QA hook suppression.

## [3.1.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Bash generation rules: polling pattern + importance** — added avoidance pattern for compound polling commands (`ls dir 2>/dev/null; echo "---"; date`), a dedicated "Polling Agent Output" section with good/bad examples, and an explicit consequence statement ("every violation causes a permission prompt that blocks the user"). Addresses LLM non-compliance with existing rules during research agent polling loops.
- **Bash generation rules: row 5 commit pattern** — replaced broken "Write tool creates file" recommendation with `git commit -F /dev/stdin << 'EOF'` which actually works (Write tool rejects new files).

## [3.1.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Stats capture works from worktrees** — STATS_FILE is now an absolute path via `compute_repo_root()`, eliminating the need to `cd` back to main repo root before capturing stats. Removes prose workarounds in do-work and stats-capture-schema.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Faster compact-prep** — direct memory writes (no temp files), immediate ccusage snapshot. Eliminates ~15 minutes of overhead from the deferred temp-file pattern.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-03-12

### Features

- **Faster session-end workflow** — compact-prep rewritten from 9 sequential prompts to a check-then-act batch architecture with a single consolidated prompt. All checks run silently, then one AskUserQuestion presents what to skip (inverted multi-select).
- **`/do:abandon` skill for session-end capture** — new thin workflow skill for sessions that won't be resumed. Invokes `/do:compact-prep --abandon`, which skips post-compaction task queue and adapts summary wording.
- **5 config toggles for compact-prep** — `compact_version_check`, `compact_cost_summary`, `compact_auto_commit`, `compact_compound_check`, `compact_push` in `compound-workflows.local.md`. Toggled-off steps skip entirely (no check, no batch action). `compact_auto_commit` is opt-in (default false); others default true.
- **Session-end language auto-detection** — routing rules detect abandonment language ("done for today", "wrapping up") and suggest `/do:abandon` inline. Suppressed after 2 ignores or explicit dismissal.
- **`--abandon` flag on compact-prep** — skips post-compaction task queue and adapts summary for sessions that won't be resumed. `/do:abandon` is the user-facing entry point.

### Changed

- Skills: 28 to 29 (added do-abandon)

## [3.0.6] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **write-tool-discipline.sh QA script** — Tier 1 check detects heredoc (`<< 'EOF'`), echo redirect (`echo >> file`), and inline commit flag (`git commit -m`) patterns in LLM-interpreted `.md` files. Supports `write-tool-exempt` and `heuristic-exempt` markers. Tier 1 script count: 8 to 9.
- **migrate-stats-keys.sh** — Heuristic-safe script for conditional config key migration. Replaces inline `echo >> file` blocks in do-setup and setup skills with script delegation, consistent with append-snapshot.sh precedent.

### Fixed

- **Write tool discipline: 10 violation fixes** — Replace heredoc patterns (2), echo redirect patterns (4), and underspecified commit method patterns (4) across 7 skill files. All commit instructions now specify Write tool + `git commit -F` method. All file append instructions now use Edit/Write tool instead of shell redirects.
- **Tier 1 QA scan scope expanded** — `context-lean-grep.sh`, `no-shell-atomicity.sh`, `unslugged-paths.sh`, and `truncation-check.sh` now scan `skills/*/workflows/*.md` in addition to existing scope. Closes blind spot where workflow files in `create-agent-skills/workflows/` were invisible to Tier 1 checks.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-03-12

### Changed

- **Expand permissive profile** — Add 11 rules: git, ls, mkdir, md5, bd, shell constructs (if, for, [[, xargs, tee), WebFetch. Add safe git patterns and ls to standard add-on. Existing permissive users: re-run `/do:setup` to pick up new rules.
- **Documentation: $() is a hard heuristic** — Step 0 verification discovered that static rules do NOT suppress the $() heuristic in Claude Code 2.1.74, contradicting prior documentation. This means `Bash(X:*)` rules only help for commands without $() — the Bash Generation Rules (avoiding $()) remain the primary mitigation.

## [3.0.4] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **capture-stats.sh: read usage line from stdin** — The `<usage>` line was passed as a positional argument, causing Claude Code's shell redirection heuristic to fire on every stats capture call (angle brackets look like redirects). Now reads from stdin via pipe. Callers use a two-step pattern: Write tool saves usage to `.workflows/.usage-pipe`, then `cat .workflows/.usage-pipe | bash capture-stats.sh <8 args>`. Updated all 5 workflow skill files, stats-capture-schema.md, and QA tests.

## [3.0.3] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed

- **Remove .tmp→mv from LLM agents** — semantic-checks.md and classify-stats/SKILL.md no longer instruct agents to write to `.tmp` then `mv`. The Write tool is already atomic; the shell pattern caused unnecessary `mv` and heredoc permission prompts. lib.sh and orchestrator cleanup are unchanged (legitimate shell).
- **New QA script: no-shell-atomicity.sh** — Tier 1 check detects `.tmp` write instructions in agent/skill `.md` files. Exempts `rm -f` cleanup lines, `.sh` scripts, and `*/references/*`. Prevents recurrence of the cargo-culted shell pattern.

## [3.0.2] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **capture-stats.sh: distinguish missing usage from changed format** — Added `elif` branch to differentiate "no `<usage>` data in response" (informational, normal for some dispatch types) from "usage data present but unparseable" (actual format change warning). Previously both triggered the misleading "format may have changed" warning. New QA test case (Test 6) validates the distinction.
- **do:work stats capture worktree reminder** — Added explicit warning in the Stats Capture section that `capture-stats.sh` must be called from the main repo root, not from the worktree cwd. `.workflows/stats/` does not exist in worktrees.
- **Remove `rm:*` from permissive profile** — `rm` is destructive and static rules fire before the hook, bypassing path-scoping guardrails. Removed from both the warning list and rule list in do:setup.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Slug all `.workflows/` write paths with DATE-RUN_ID** — 22 static `.workflows/` paths in plugin-changes-qa and classify-stats now use `$DATE-$RUN_ID` stems, preventing overwrites on repeat runs. do-work review path also slugged with RUN_ID.
- **Rename `.workflows/tmp/` to `.workflows/scratch/` in do-work** — prevents model confusion with system `/tmp/` directory
- **Fix hardcoded `my-feature` in disk-persist-agents template** — replaced with `$FEATURE_OR_TOPIC` placeholder

### Added
- **`unslugged-paths.sh` Tier 1 QA script** — checks `.workflows/` write paths in skills for variable placeholders, catching static filenames that would overwrite on repeat runs. Tier 1 script count: 6 to 7.
- **init-values.sh DATE+RUN_ID emission** — extended init-values.sh to emit `DATE` and `RUN_ID` variables for plugin-changes-qa and classify-stats consumers (previously only emitted for workflow skills)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Breaking Changes
- **Namespace rename: `compound:` to `do:`** — all 8 workflow commands migrated from `commands/compound/` to `skills/do-*/`. Invocation changes from `/compound:brainstorm` to `/do:brainstorm` (shorthand) or `/compound-workflows:do:brainstorm` (full). Thin aliases in `commands/compound/` redirect to `/do:*` for one version.

### Features
- **`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` path resolution** — all workflow skills and script-referencing skills use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (Claude Code v2.1.69+) for path resolution. Works reliably in installed plugin contexts, eliminating hardcoded repo-relative paths and `find` fallbacks.
- **No 8-command limit** — skills have no per-directory limit (commands were capped at 8 per directory). All 8 workflows are now skills with room for growth.
- **init-values.sh PLUGIN_ROOT validation** — new `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` existence check validates the `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../../` depth assumption at runtime. Fails loudly if the skill directory structure changes.
- **Skill-to-skill reference validation (QA Check 2b)** — new check in `stale-references.sh` validates `/do:<name>` references against existing `skills/do-*/` directories. Catches stale cross-references between skills.

### Migration Notes
- Thin aliases in `commands/compound/` redirect `/compound:*` to `/do:*` skills for one version. Users should update muscle memory, docs, and any memory files referencing `/compound:*`.
- Aliases will be removed in the next version.
- 5 existing skills updated to use `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`: version, plugin-changes-qa, classify-stats, git-worktree, resolve-pr-parallel.
- Skills: 20 to 28 (8 new workflow skills). Agents: 26 (unchanged). Commands: 8 (now thin aliases).

## [2.6.1] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **setup: bash prompt reduction opt-in** — new Step 8e offers to inject Bash Generation Rules into the project's CLAUDE.md. Rules teach the model to avoid `$()`, `2>/dev/null` + glob, heredoc, and other patterns that trigger permission prompt heuristics during ad-hoc conversation bash. Advisory ("SHOULD avoid") with escape valves for atomic operations. Also suggests complementary static rules (`which`, `echo`, `mkdir`) for Standard profile users.

### Fixed
- **compact-prep: heredoc hard heuristic** — `<<` is unsuppressible by static rules (disproves v2.5.1 assumption). Replaced Read+Write approach with `append-snapshot.sh` script, consistent with capture-stats.sh pattern. Updated solution doc, brainstorms, and Permission Architecture with hard vs soft heuristic distinction.

### Added
- **Plugin CLAUDE.md: Bash Generation Rules reference** — documents the opt-in mechanism under Permission Architecture section
- **resources/bash-generation-rules.md** — template for rules injected by setup into project CLAUDE.md

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **compact-prep: heredoc permission prompt** — replaced `cat >> file <<EOF` with Read+Write tool append for ccusage snapshot persistence. Heredoc `<<` triggers permission heuristic even with `Bash(cat:*)` static rule.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-11

### Features
- **init-values.sh** — shared script computing PLUGIN_ROOT, RUN_ID, DATE, STATS_FILE. Auto-approved by PreToolUse hook (no permission prompt). Eliminates 29 `$()` init patterns across 12 files.
- **check-sentinel.sh** — sentinel staleness detection script replacing 3-pattern inline block in work.md. Returns structured status for model-side branching.
- **Expanded QA Check 5** — broader `$()` regex (any position, not just `VAR=$()` assignments), skills + agents scan scope, backtick substitution detection. Fixed `\x60` character-class bug in macOS grep.

### Changed
- **7 command files migrated to init-values.sh** — brainstorm, plan, review, work, deepen-plan, compact-prep, setup all source shared init script instead of inline `$()` blocks
- **7 skill files cleaned** — eliminated 11 `$()` patterns via init-values.sh sourcing, split-call rewrites, and direct substitutions
- **Net: 51 `$()` patterns eliminated, 27 exempt markers removed, zero residuals**

## [2.4.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **capture-stats.sh: format-agnostic parsing** — extraction uses `[>:]` character class to handle space-delimited, comma-separated, newline-separated, and XML-style tag formats. Health check accepts any format containing `<usage>` wrapper with known field names.

### Changed
- **capture-stats-format.sh** — added test 4 for XML-style nested tags (`<total_tokens>N</total_tokens>`), now 5 test cases total

## [2.4.2] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **capture-stats.sh: accept Agent tool usage format** — health check regex now accepts both newline-separated (Agent tool) and comma-separated (Task tool) `<usage>` formats. Best-effort extraction already worked for both; only the health check warned incorrectly.
- **context-lean-grep: zero-findings baseline** — added `context-lean-exempt` markers to 18 verified-correct MCP tool references inside Task subagent blocks. Check 3 now respects exempt markers. All Tier 1 QA scripts produce zero findings.

### Added
- **capture-stats-format.sh** — Tier 1 QA test fixture validating capture-stats.sh with both formats, empty usage, and timeout variant (4 test cases)

## [2.4.1] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed
- **Eliminate mid-workflow permission prompts** — replace 9 inline `ENTRY_COUNT=$(grep -c ...)` blocks with `validate-stats.sh` script across brainstorm, plan, deepen-plan, work, review commands
- **P5 subshell cleanup** — remove unnecessary `$(echo $VAR)` subshells in work.md and review.md init blocks
- **Sentinel redesign** — clear via Write tool marker instead of `rm -f` in work.md (Phase 4 Ship + Phase 2.4 Recovery)
- **QA regression check** — new Check 5 in `context-lean-grep.sh` detects `VAR=$()` heuristic trigger patterns with `# heuristic-exempt` suppress markers

### Added
- `scripts/validate-stats.sh` — diagnostic stats entry count validation (exits 0 always, warn-on-empty for Sonnet robustness, report-only mode)

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-10

### Features
- **PreToolUse auto-approve hook** — programmable auto-approval for known-safe operations via `.claude/hooks/auto-approve.sh`. Quote-aware compound command splitting, path-scoped `rm`/`mkdir`/`bash`/`python3` validation, redirect/substitution pre-checks, git destructive operation guardrails, Write/Edit `.workflows/**` scoping, and audit logging to `.workflows/.hook-audit.log`. Ships as a template (`templates/auto-approve.sh`) installed by `/compound:setup`.
- **Setup command permission configuration** — new Step 7 in `/compound:setup` with two profiles (Standard/Permissive). Standard uses hook-only auto-approval; Permissive adds static `Bash(*)` rules with explicit warnings about hook bypass. Idempotent merge logic, first-run migration for >20 exact-command rules, jq dependency check.
- **Committed settings baseline** — `.claude/settings.json` ships with `permissions.allow` for Write/Edit `.workflows/**`, PreToolUse hook registration, and preserved PostToolUse QA hook.

### Added
- New `plugins/compound-workflows/templates/` directory for installable template files
- `templates/auto-approve.sh` — PreToolUse hook template copied to `.claude/hooks/` during setup

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-10

### Features
- **Per-agent token instrumentation** — all 5 orchestrator commands (work, brainstorm, plan, deepen-plan, review) now capture per-dispatch stats (`<usage>` token counts, tool uses, duration) to `.workflows/stats/` YAML files. Deterministic `capture-stats.sh` bash script handles atomic append — no LLM-mediated file I/O. Toggleable via `stats_capture: false` in `compound-workflows.local.md`.
- **capture-stats.sh** — new bash script for deterministic YAML stats entry construction and atomic `cat >>` append. Handles success, failure, timeout, and unparseable `<usage>` formats. Always exits 0 (never blocks command execution).
- **stats-capture-schema.md** — new reference document in `resources/` with full YAML schema (14 fields), `<usage>` discovery instructions, model resolution algorithm (4-step priority chain), worktree handling, and post-dispatch validation procedures.
- **compact-prep ccusage snapshot** — persists ccusage daily cost data as YAML snapshot to `.workflows/stats/` with atomic append.
- **`/compound-workflows:classify-stats` skill** — post-hoc complexity and output_type classification for stats entries. Dispatches classifier subagent, presents batch table, supports confirm/override/skip. Atomic tmp+mv rewrite for data integrity.
- **Settings infrastructure** — `stats_capture` and `stats_classify` toggles added to setup command/skill with migration for existing users. Missing keys default to enabled.

### Changed
- Skills: 19→20 (added classify-stats)
- New `plugins/compound-workflows/resources/` directory for shared reference files (stats-capture-schema.md)
- New `plugins/compound-workflows/scripts/capture-stats.sh` for stats capture

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-10

### Features
- **plan: Phase 6.8 red team challenge** — added a red team gate to `/compound:plan` with Yes/Skip AskUserQuestion, 3-provider parallel dispatch (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude Opus), 7-dimension challenge prompt (assumptions, risks, alternatives, complexity, gaps, dependencies, problem selection), and CRITICAL/SERIOUS/MINOR triage with auto-fix for trivially-fixable MINORs.
- **plan: Phase 6.9 conditional readiness re-check** — after red team triage, detects plan modifications via SHA-256 hash comparison and re-runs the full readiness check pipeline (Phase 6.7) if the plan changed. Skips gracefully when hash matches.
- **plan: Phase 7 decision tree update** — expanded the handoff decision tree from 5 rules to 7, adding red-team-specific routing: red team clean with no deferred findings routes directly to work, red team with deferred SERIOUS findings routes to deepen-plan.
- **deepen-plan: 7th red team dimension** — added "problem selection" dimension to the deepen-plan red team challenge prompt, questioning whether the plan solves the right problem.
- **brainstorm: 6th red team dimension** — added "problem selection" dimension to the brainstorm red team challenge prompt, consistent with deepen-plan.
- **CLAUDE.md registry update** — added `plan` to the `red-team-relay` agent's "Dispatched By" column, reflecting the new Phase 6.8 dispatch.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-10

### Features
- **deepen-plan: native agent discovery** — replaced filesystem-based agent/skill discovery (Phase 2) with Claude Code's native subagent_type registry. Eliminates `find ~/.claude/plugins/cache` commands that hit sandbox restrictions and caused bash approval cascades. Agent roster now built by reading available subagent_types from the system prompt, with invariant check (security-sentinel + architecture-strategist always present), hardcoded 19-agent fallback, and deterministic post-discovery validation pipeline (dedup, C1 hallucination check, 30-agent cap).
- **deepen-plan: user-defined agent support** — non-compound-workflows agents matching `*:review:*` or `*:research:*` are now discovered and included in the roster (e.g., third-party plugin review agents).
- **deepen-plan: Agent tool dispatch** — migrated all Task dispatches to Agent tool across Phases 3, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, and 5.75. Enables `model` parameter override at dispatch time. Phase 5 (Recovery) backward-compatible with pre-migration manifests.
- **deepen-plan: skills discovery** — plugin-cache skills discovery replaced with system prompt reading. Local skills discovery retained (`find .claude/skills ~/.claude/skills -name "SKILL.md"`). Learnings discovery unchanged.
- **QA scripts: Agent dispatch detection** — `stale-references.sh` and `context-lean-grep.sh` now detect both `Task` and `Agent(subagent_type:` dispatch patterns, preventing false negatives after Agent migration.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-09

### Breaking Changes
- Research agents now use Sonnet model for balanced cost/quality (5 agents: repo-research-analyst, context-researcher, learnings-researcher, best-practices-researcher, framework-docs-researcher)
- Red team relay dispatches now use named `red-team-relay` agent with Sonnet model (8 dispatch points in brainstorm.md and deepen-plan.md)
- No Haiku tier — previously-Haiku agents (context-researcher, learnings-researcher) promoted to Sonnet for better summary quality

### Features
- Stack-based dynamic agent selection for deepen-plan (3 rules: skip language-mismatched reviewers based on stack config)
- ccusage session cost tracking in compact-prep (graceful skip when not installed)
- Convergence advisor uses named dispatch pattern (consistency with other workflow agents)
- New agent: `red-team-relay` (workflow category, model: sonnet)

### Migration Notes
- Agent model assignments changed — research agents and relay dispatches now use Sonnet instead of Opus/Haiku
- Relay dispatches gracefully degrade to Opus (general-purpose) if red-team-relay agent file is not found
- Individual agents can be rolled back by changing `model: sonnet` to `model: inherit` in their YAML frontmatter
- `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` environment variable affects agents WITHOUT explicit `model:` fields only — does NOT override explicit `model: sonnet` settings. Review agents using `model: inherit` would be affected.
- Agent count: 25 → 26

## [1.13.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **version-check.sh consumer project bug** — script read "Source" from its own cached location (e.g., 1.11.0 cache entry) instead of detecting it's not in the source repo. Now detects context: in source repo does 3-way comparison (source vs installed vs release), in consumer projects does 2-way (installed vs release only). No longer uses `dirname $0` for source detection.
- **QA agent noise reduction** — Tier 2 agents (context-lean reviewer, role-description reviewer) now distinguish expected patterns from real issues. Inline role description drift is INFO not MINOR (by-design graceful fallback). Foreground Task delegation to agent .md files is recognized as a DRY pattern, not a violation. Style observations (summary format) downgraded to INFO.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **All remaining hardcoded plugin paths** — plan.md, deepen-plan.md, work.md, setup.md, and plugin-changes-qa now resolve `$PLUGIN_ROOT` dynamically via `find`. Previously plan-checks scripts, convergence-signals.sh, worktree-manager.sh, and Tier 2 agent file reads all used paths that only existed in the source repo.

### Changed
- **Setup routing merge** — Step 7c now diffs existing routing rules against the canonical version and offers to merge instead of silently skipping.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Setup routing rules** — Step 7c writes a "Compound Workflows Routing" section to the user's AGENTS.md during setup, mapping question types to commands (brainstorm, plan, deepen-plan, work, review, compound, compact-prep, recover). Skips if routing rules already exist.

### Changed
- **compact-prep UNRELEASED check** — now only offers to create releases when in the plugin source repo (`plugins/compound-workflows/` exists locally). Regular users see UNRELEASED as informational only.

## [1.12.2] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Hardcoded plugin script paths** — version-check.sh and plugin-qa script paths now resolve dynamically via `find`, trying local repo first then searching `$HOME/.claude/plugins/`. Previously only worked in the source repo, not in consumer projects installed via marketplace. Affects compact-prep, setup, version skill, and plugin-changes-qa skill.

## [1.12.1] - 2026-03-09

### Fixed
- **Stale `/compound:recover` references** — updated to `/compound-workflows:recover` in recover SKILL.md, CLAUDE.md, and README.md (recover is a skill, not a command)
- **compact-prep `$ARGUMENTS` syntax** — changed to `#$ARGUMENTS` to match all other commands (enables argument interpolation)
- **work.md sequential-as-safer bias** — reworded dispatch guidance so parallel is recommended when steps touch separate files, not treated as an exception

## [1.12.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Phase 3.3 (Beads Cross-Reference) in plugin-changes-qa** — cross-references aggregated QA findings against open beads after Tier 1 + Tier 2 checks complete. Hybrid matching: deterministic text matching (check-name, file path, provenance token) for Tier 1 findings, LLM subagent for Tier 2 and unmatched findings. Coverage assessment identifies partially-covered beads. Staged batch confirmation via AskUserQuestion (Apply all / Review individually / Skip). Bead operations include `bd create` with provenance tokens, `bd update --append-notes` with dedup, and consecutive failure abort after 3 failures. Gracefully skips when beads is unavailable.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **version-check.sh** — 3-way version comparison script (source vs installed vs release) in `scripts/`. Not in `plugin-qa/` because it makes network calls (would slow every commit via the PostToolUse hook)
- **version-sync.sh** — QA script in `scripts/plugin-qa/` validating version consistency across plugin.json, marketplace.json, and CHANGELOG.md
- **`/compound-workflows:version` skill** — wraps version-check.sh for interactive version status checks
- **compact-prep Step 6** now runs version-check.sh (replaces inline `gh` check with structured 3-way comparison)
- **setup.md Step 1.5** — warns about stale plugin versions before environment detection
- **work.md Phase 4** post-merge release reminder — prompts user to tag + release after version bumps

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md** — versioning checklist aligned to 4-file set (plugin.json, marketplace.json, CHANGELOG.md, README.md), scripts directory listing updated
- **AGENTS.md** — versioning list aligned to 4-file set, phantom `ref` field removed, QA scripts table updated with version-sync.sh
- Skills: 18→19, plugin-qa scripts: 4→5

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Three-category MINOR triage** — replaces binary "batch-accept or review individually" at all 4 triage points (brainstorm.md Phase 3.5 Step 3, deepen-plan.md Synthesis Gate Step 4, deepen-plan.md Red Team Step 3, plan-consolidator.md Section 6). Subagent now categorizes each MINOR finding as "fixable now" (with proposed edit), "needs manual review" (present individually), or "no action needed" (acknowledge with reason). Users can apply all fixes, cherry-pick, review individually, or acknowledge all. Post-fix verification ensures edits match proposals.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Phase 7 handoff recommendation** — plan.md Phase 7 now recommends deepen-plan or work based on readiness findings, using a decision tree that evaluates severity counts, deferred findings, material modification, brainstorm origin, and step count
- **Feedback loop log** — tracks recommendation vs user choice at `.workflows/plan-research/<plan-stem>/recommendation-log.md` for future calibration

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added
- **convergence-advisor agent** — Workflow agent that classifies deepen-plan findings as genuine vs edit-induced and produces one of 4 convergence recommendations (converged/ready for work, consolidate then evaluate, recommend another run, recommend another run after consolidation)
- **convergence-signals.sh script** (`agents/workflow/plan-checks/`) — Bash script computing 5 structured convergence metrics from readiness reports and manifests: new-finding rate, repeat-finding rate, severity trend, unresolved count, and churn ratio

### Changed
- **deepen-plan.md** — Phase 5.75 (convergence signal dispatch), Phase 6 (present convergence recommendation to user), Phase 1 (read prior signals for anti-anchoring: next run reads prior signals but not prior recommendation)
- Agents: 24→25, plan-checks scripts: 3→4

## [1.8.6] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Pass `.worktrees/<name>` to `bd worktree create/remove` — bd uses the path as-is and defaults to repo root, causing worktrees outside `.worktrees/`

## [1.8.5] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- Release check in `/compound:compact-prep` — detects missing GitHub releases when plugin version was bumped

## [1.8.4] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Enforce worktree creation via `bd worktree` or `worktree-manager.sh` — prohibit raw `git worktree add` which creates worktrees in wrong location
- Add `worktree-manager.sh` as fallback when `bd` is unavailable (create, remove, recovery)
- Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`
- Fix stale invocation path `/compound:plugin-changes-qa` → `/compound-workflows:plugin-changes-qa` in AGENTS.md and QA hook
- Fix stale skill/command counts in CLAUDE.md and README.md (18 skills, 8 commands)

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-08

### Changed
- Move `plugin-changes-qa` and `recover` from commands to skills — works around Claude Code per-directory command limit. Invocation changes: `/compound-workflows:plugin-changes-qa` and `/compound-workflows:recover`
- Commands: 10→8, Skills: 16→18

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Shorten all skill and command descriptions (63% reduction, 4577→1677 chars) to fit within Claude Code's skill character budget ([#13343](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/13343))

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Remove `license` and `keywords` fields from plugin.json — unknown fields break command registration in Claude Code ([#20415](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/20415))
- Remove redundant `user-invocable: true` from plugin-changes-qa command frontmatter

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- MCP red team responses wrapped in Task subagents (brainstorm.md, deepen-plan.md) — prevents orchestrator context bloat
- resolve-pr-parallel now uses disk-persist pattern with run namespacing

### Added
- `/compound:plugin-changes-qa` command — hybrid QA: Tier 1 bash scripts (structural) + Tier 2 LLM agents (semantic)
- PostToolUse hook for automated Tier 1 QA on plugin file commits (`.claude/hooks/plugin-qa-check.sh`)
- Context-Lean Convention section in CLAUDE.md — defines rules, OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS variants, zero exceptions policy
- Sentinel file lifecycle in work.md — suppresses hook during `/compound:work` execution

### Changed
- AGENTS.md: manual QA check prompts replaced with automated `/compound:plugin-changes-qa` reference
- orchestrating-swarms skill marked as beta with context-lean warning banner
- "context-safe" → "context-lean" terminology across all command files, skills, and plugin.json keyword

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **plan-readiness-reviewer agent** — Workflow agent that aggregates and deduplicates plan readiness check outputs into a work-readiness report. Zero plan-file write authority.
- **plan-consolidator agent** — Workflow agent that fixes plan readiness issues with evidence-based auto-fixes and guardrailed user decisions. Constrained write authority with preservation rules.
- **3 mechanical check scripts** (`agents/workflow/plan-checks/`): `stale-values.sh`, `broken-references.sh`, `audit-trail-bloat.sh` — deterministic bash checks for stale values, broken references, and annotation bloat
- **1 semantic checks agent** (`agents/workflow/plan-checks/semantic-checks.md`) — LLM-based check module performing 5 semantic passes: contradictions, unresolved-disputes, underspecification, accretion, external-verification (co-located with shell scripts, not a standalone registry agent)
- **`plan_readiness` config section** in `compound-workflows.md` — 3 flat keys under `## Plan Readiness` heading: `plan_readiness_skip_checks`, `plan_readiness_provenance_expiry_days`, `plan_readiness_verification_source_policy`
- **Phase 6.7 in plan.md** — plan readiness gate before handoff to `/compound:work`
- **Phase 5.5 in deepen-plan.md** — plan readiness gate after triage integration

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **`/compound:recover` command** — Reactive counterpart to `/compound:compact-prep`. Recovers context from dead or exhausted Claude Code sessions by parsing JSONL session logs, cross-referencing external state (beads, git, .workflows/, plans), and producing a structured recovery manifest at `.workflows/recover/<session-id>/`. Includes session picker, head+tail extraction with 50KB context budget, decision/error/subagent detection, and memory extraction for unpreserved rationale.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Setup tutorial walkthrough** — Step 6 explains project structure (docs/, resources/, memory/, .workflows/), workflow cycle, `/compound:` command shorthand, and Workflow Instructions customization
- **`resources/` directory** created by `/compound:setup` — for external reference material (API docs, specs, research papers). Searched recursively by context-researcher.
- **Git repo prerequisite check** in `/compound:setup` — fails fast if not in a git repo
- **Beads initialization offer** in `/compound:setup` — offers `bd init` if beads is installed but not initialized
- **`.gitignore` management** in `/compound:setup` — offers to untrack `.workflows/`/`resources/`/`memory/`, ensures `compound-workflows.local.md` is gitignored
- **Workflow Instructions** config section — plugin-specific overrides (red team focus areas, domain constraints, review emphasis) replacing generic "Project Context"

### Changed

- **7 reference-only skills hidden from command palette** — added `user-invocable: false` to compound-docs, setup, brainstorming, disk-persist-agents, document-review, orchestrating-swarms, and agent-native-architecture
- **`Resources/` → `resources/`** — lowercase, consistent with other directories. Updated in context-researcher, brainstorm, and plugin README.
- **context-researcher genericized** — removed project-specific descriptions and examples leaked from fork source
- **Setup directory check** covers all 7 directories with per-directory status reporting

### Fixed

- **Install instructions** corrected to `/plugin marketplace add` + `/plugin install`
- **Attribution** — copyright holder corrected to Every (matches upstream LICENSE), upstream URL fixed to EveryInc/compound-engineering-plugin
- **Hallucinated fork version** `v2.35.2` removed — no such upstream release exists
- **PAL MCP and beads links** corrected
- **Hardcoded dates** in work.md examples replaced with `YYYY-MM-DD`
- **TodoWrite mode blocks** added to work.md section 2.2 and Phase 4 step 5

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **`clink` support for red team reviews** — Gemini CLI and Codex CLI can now be used as red team providers via PAL `clink`, giving models direct file access in the repo for richer analysis. Falls back to `pal chat` or Claude-only if CLIs aren't available.
- **Gemini CLI and Codex CLI detection** in `/compound:setup` — detects installed CLIs, guides users through one-time per-repo file access permission grant
- **Full TodoWrite fallback in `/compound:work`** — TodoWrite mode blocks at all divergence points: worktree setup, issue creation, dispatch loop, result handling, recovery, quality check, and worktree cleanup. Previously only detection at the top with a "mentally replace" instruction.
- **Full Task dispatch syntax in `/compound:compound`** — all 8 agent dispatches (5 Phase 1 + 3 Phase 3) now have complete `Task` blocks with inline role descriptions. Previously agents 2-5 were shorthand references.
- **AGENTS.md** — project-specific agent instructions with reusable QA process (4 parallel checks covering all 8 commands, stale references, and CLAUDE.md consistency)

### Changed

- **Config split into two files** — `compound-workflows.md` (committed, shared project config: stack, agents, depth) and `compound-workflows.local.md` (gitignored, per-machine: tracker, gh_cli). Previously a single `compound-workflows.local.md` held everything.
- **Red team providers run independently in parallel** — all three providers (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude Opus) now review independently with no provider reading another's critique. Previously sequential (Gemini first, then OpenAI/Opus reading prior critiques). Rationale: reading prior critiques anchors models and reduces independent insight; deduplication happens at triage.
- **Red team provider preference is runtime-detected** — CLI and PAL availability checked each session, user asked to choose if multiple options exist. Previously stored in config (went stale across machines).
- **PAL write-to-disk made explicit** — PAL `chat` and `clink` responses now have explicit "After receiving the response, write it to: [path]" instructions. PAL returns strings, doesn't write files.
- **AskUserQuestion consistency** across all 8 commands — every user decision point now explicitly specifies AskUserQuestion. Fixed ~12 instances of "ask the user" or "suggest" without the tool name.
- **Conditional review agents** in `/compound:review` now have explicit `(run_in_background: true)` and `[disk-write for:]` instructions, matching the standard agent format
- **Batch-accept paths** in `/compound:deepen-plan` now prompt for user reasoning, consistent with "record the why" principle

### Fixed

- **`bd sync --flush-only` removed from `/compound:work`** — nonexistent command (same fix previously applied to compact-prep)
- **Phase 4 step numbering** in `/compound:work` — was 1,2,3,5,6,7; now sequential 1-6
- **`/resolve_todo_parallel`** reference removed from `/compound:review` — command doesn't exist in plugin
- **`/test-browser` and `/xcode-test`** references removed from `/compound:review` — replaced with generic test guidance
- **`/resolve_todo_parallel`** reference removed from `skills/file-todos/SKILL.md`
- **Hardcoded date** `2026-02-23` removed from `/compound:review` example
- **"work skill"** → "`/compound:work` command" in `/compound:deepen-plan`

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- **`/compound:compact-prep` command** — Pre-compaction checklist that preserves session context: memory update, beads sync, compound check (before compaction), dual commit checks, and post-compaction task queuing
- **Rationale-capture instructions** in brainstorm, plan, and deepen-plan — commands now record *why* the user made decisions, not just what they decided. User reasoning evaporates with conversation context; documents are the only durable record.
- **Work-readiness guidance** in plan and deepen-plan handoffs — assess step sizing for subagent dispatch, flag oversized steps, identify parallelism opportunities
- **Zero untriaged items principle** across brainstorm, plan, and deepen-plan — every finding, question, or concern must be explicitly resolved, deferred by the user, or removed before handoff. Nothing silently applied, nothing accidentally skipped.
- **Red team model examples** — specific model recommendations: Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview, GPT 5.4 Pro, Claude Opus via Task subagent

### Changed

- **Consolidated triage in deepen-plan** — synthesis findings AND red team findings now go through the same triage flow. Previously synthesis findings were silently written into the plan without user review.
- **AskUserQuestion in compact-prep** — compound check now uses structured options instead of waiting for free text
- **Setup creates `.workflows/` directory** and warns if it's gitignored — recommends committing for research traceability
- **README `.workflows/` guidance** — changed from "gitignore this" to "recommend committing for traceability"
- **Smoke test plan** — updated to 13 tests covering all 8 commands, fixed duplicate test numbering

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Changed

- **Command namespace shortened** from verbose prefix to `compound:*` across all 7 commands
  - `/compound:brainstorm`, `/compound:plan`, `/compound:work`, `/compound:review`, `/compound:compound`, `/compound:deepen-plan`, `/compound:setup`
  - Shorter prefix improves UX -- easier to type and remember
  - Plugin name (`compound-workflows`) and config file (`compound-workflows.local.md`) unchanged
- **Commands directory renamed:** `commands/compound-workflows/` to `commands/compound/`

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **21 new agents** (6 research, 13 review, 3 workflow) -- 22 total with existing context-researcher
  - Research (5 new): best-practices-researcher, framework-docs-researcher, git-history-analyzer, learnings-researcher, repo-research-analyst
  - Review (13 new): agent-native-reviewer, architecture-strategist, code-simplicity-reviewer, data-integrity-guardian, data-migration-expert, deployment-verification-agent, frontend-races-reviewer, pattern-recognition-specialist, performance-oracle, python-reviewer, schema-drift-detector, security-sentinel, typescript-reviewer
  - Workflow (3 new): bug-reproduction-validator, pr-comment-resolver, spec-flow-analyzer

- **14 new skills** (5 command-referenced + 9 utility) -- 15 total with existing disk-persist-agents
  - Command-referenced: brainstorming, compound-docs, orchestrating-swarms, resolve-pr-parallel, setup
  - Utility: agent-browser, agent-native-architecture, create-agent-skills, document-review, file-todos, frontend-design, gemini-imagegen, git-worktree, skill-creator

- **NOTICE file** with full MIT license text and attribution to Every

- **FORK-MANIFEST.yaml** tracking per-file provenance from the upstream source plugin

### Changed

- **3 agents renamed/depersonalized:** kieran-typescript-reviewer -> typescript-reviewer, kieran-python-reviewer -> python-reviewer, julik-frontend-races-reviewer -> frontend-races-reviewer

- **7 commands updated** for self-contained plugin:
  - work-agents.md merged into work.md (subagent dispatch is now the default mode)
  - setup.md fully rewritten -- detects bundled agents, warns on upstream plugin conflict
  - deepen-plan.md discovery logic rewritten for generic plugin agent discovery
  - brainstorm.md and deepen-plan.md red team methodology upgraded to 3-provider parallel (Gemini + OpenAI + Claude Opus)
  - brainstorm.md and deepen-plan.md MINOR severity surfacing added
  - plan.md, compound.md, review.md genericized (examples updated, agent names updated)

- **Plugin is now fully self-contained** -- upstream source plugin no longer needed as a dependency

### Removed

- Upstream source plugin listed as "Recommended" dependency (superseded by bundled agents)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- **7 commands:**
  - `/compound:setup` -- Environment detection, enhancement recommendations, directory setup
  - `/compound:brainstorm` -- Collaborative dialogue with PAL/Claude red-team challenge
  - `/compound:plan` -- Disk-persisted research agents with brainstorm cross-check
  - `/compound:deepen-plan` -- Multi-run plan enhancement with red-team + consensus
  - `/compound:work` -- Subagent dispatch plan execution with beads/TodoWrite task tracking
  - `/compound:review` -- Multi-agent code review with disk-persisted outputs
  - `/compound:compound` -- Solution documentation with analytical/strategic mode

- **1 agent:**
  - `context-researcher` -- Broad knowledge base search across 5 directories, tagged by source type

- **1 skill:**
  - `disk-persist-agents` -- Reusable pattern for agents that write to disk instead of context

- **Graceful degradation:** All commands work without beads (TodoWrite fallback), PAL (Claude subagent fallback), or bundled agents (general-purpose agent fallback)

- **Acknowledgment:** Built on workflow patterns from Every's compound engineering plugin (MIT)
